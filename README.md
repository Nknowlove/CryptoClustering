## Introduction
In this challenge, I'll use my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Tools
jupyter notebook

## Key Steps
1. Prepare the Data

2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Scaled DataFrame

3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Scaled DataFrame

4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA DataFrame

6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame


## References for codes
 During the task, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others. I am a new learner of coding, have to do lots of research and reading for problem-solving.
